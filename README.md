# LegalEase AI – AI for Demystifying Legal Documents

# Objective
The main goal of LegalEase AI is to simplify complex legal documents using artificial intelligence. Our platform transforms difficult legal language into simple, easy-to-understand summaries that anyone can understand. We help users make informed decisions about legal agreements without needing a law degree.

# Purpose
LegalEase AI exists to bridge the gap between legal professionals and everyday people. Many individuals sign contracts, rental agreements, loan documents, and terms of service without fully understanding what they are agreeing to. Our tool empowers users by breaking down legal jargon into plain language, helping them identify risks and understand their rights and responsibilities.

# Problem Statement
Legal documents are filled with complex language and technical terms that are difficult for the average person to understand. This creates an information gap where people may unknowingly agree to unfavorable terms, exposing themselves to financial and legal risks. Most people cannot afford to hire lawyers to review every document they encounter, leaving them vulnerable to hidden clauses and unfair conditions.
